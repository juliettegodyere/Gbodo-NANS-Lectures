*The Box Model*

Task: Change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the .alternate class) to make it match the first box in width and height.

`.alternate {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 390px;
  height: 240px;
}`
You will need to increase the height and width of the second block, to add the size of the padding and border.

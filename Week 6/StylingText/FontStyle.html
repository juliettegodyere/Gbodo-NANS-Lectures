    <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

    <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

    <p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty
        throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this
        awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator â€” Tommy the cat had many a story to tell.
        But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.</p>
